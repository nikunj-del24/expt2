In this experiment we perform various operations on list by introducing the list by storing values on various data types in the variable then we proceed with the indexing of list as from right side indexing starts with -1 and from left side indexing start with 0 and if we want to have a values of the list in the of n. Then we had to give the range from 0 to n+1, as range runs from 0 to n+1. Then we leart how to append something in a list by using append function. Also by using insert function we can we add any value at the index of our choice. We can also adding many values by using extend function. Many other function like max,min,sum,len,sorted we can use to maximum,minimum,sum,length etc. Remove function we use to remove any element from a list.
